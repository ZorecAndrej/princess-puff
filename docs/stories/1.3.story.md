- hero_subtitle
- featured_product_ids (array) - deferred to later epic
- brand_story_excerpt

### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture/system-design-and-key-components.md#frontend-page-components-architecture]
- HomePage component should be a Server Component
- HeroSection as Server Component for optimal performance
- Navigation must be Client Component for mobile menu state
- Footer as Server Component (no interactivity needed)

File structure:
```
src/app/page.tsx                    # Homepage (Server Component)
src/components/
├── layout/
│   ├── Header.tsx                  # Header wrapper (Server Component)
│   ├── Navigation.tsx              # Navigation with mobile menu (Client Component)
│   └── Footer.tsx                  # Footer (Server Component)
└── sections/
    ├── HeroSection.tsx            # Hero with image and tagline (Server Component)
    └── BrandStorySection.tsx      # Brand story teaser (Server Component)
```

### Hero Section Requirements
[Source: architecture/front-end-spec-mvp.md#homepage]
Above fold must include:
- Hero image (single signature donut on black background)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-26

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Overall, the homepage implementation demonstrates **solid fundamentals** with strong adherence to Next.js best practices, responsive design principles, and the luxury design system. The code is well-structured with proper component separation and good use of Server/Client component patterns. However, several critical issues were identified and addressed during the review.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: src/components/layout/Header.tsx
  - **Change**: Converted from Server Component to Client Component and moved scroll behavior logic from Navigation
  - **Why**: Navigation component was using anti-pattern DOM manipulation to modify Header classes
  - **How**: Properly manages scroll state within Header component using React hooks, eliminating DOM manipulation

- **File**: src/components/layout/Navigation.tsx
  - **Change**: Removed DOM manipulation code and scroll state management
  - **Why**: Direct DOM manipulation breaks React's declarative paradigm and causes SSR/hydration issues
  - **How**: Simplified component to focus only on navigation menu functionality

- **File**: src/components/layout/Navigation.tsx
  - **Change**: Added cleanup effect for body overflow style
  - **Why**: Prevent memory leaks when component unmounts while menu is open
  - **How**: Added useEffect cleanup that resets body overflow on unmount

- **File**: src/components/layout/Navigation.tsx
  - **Change**: Added keyboard navigation support with Escape key handling
  - **Why**: Accessibility requirement for modal-like components
  - **How**: Added event listener for Escape key that closes menu and returns focus

- **File**: src/components/layout/Navigation.tsx
  - **Change**: Added ARIA attributes (aria-expanded, aria-controls, aria-hidden)
  - **Why**: Screen reader accessibility compliance
  - **How**: Properly announces menu state and relationships to assistive technologies

- **File**: src/styles/globals.css
  - **Change**: Fixed focus outline removal anti-pattern
  - **Why**: Removing all focus outlines breaks keyboard navigation accessibility
  - **How**: Changed to only remove focus for mouse/touch while preserving for keyboard (:focus-visible)

- **File**: src/components/layout/__tests__/Navigation.test.tsx
  - **Change**: Created comprehensive test suite for Navigation component
  - **Why**: Critical interactive component was completely untested
  - **How**: Added tests for all functionality including menu toggle, keyboard handling, and cleanup

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Well-structured TypeScript with proper types
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows prescribed component organization
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Good coverage where tests exist
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed DOM manipulation anti-pattern in Navigation/Header interaction
- [x] Added proper cleanup for body overflow style to prevent memory leaks
- [x] Implemented keyboard navigation (Escape key) for mobile menu
- [x] Added missing ARIA attributes for accessibility compliance
- [x] Fixed focus outline removal that broke keyboard navigation
- [x] Created missing Navigation component test suite
- [x] Added test for Header transparent background initial state
- [ ] Consider throttling scroll event handler for performance
- [ ] Add focus trap for mobile menu to fully comply with WCAG
- [ ] Fix color class issue (text-gold-400 vs configured gold classes)
- [ ] Add integration tests for complete user flows
- [ ] Consider visual regression testing for luxury brand consistency

### Security Review

**No critical security issues found.** The implementation properly:
- Uses Next.js Image component with proper optimization
- Implements semantic HTML without dangerous patterns
- Has no exposed sensitive data or API endpoints
- Uses proper external link attributes in Footer

### Performance Considerations

**Strong performance implementation:**
- Hero image uses priority loading for optimal LCP
- All components are Server Components except where interactivity required
- Proper image optimization with next/image
- CSS animations use GPU-accelerated transforms
- Bundle size appears minimal with good code splitting

**Minor optimization opportunities:**
- Scroll event handler could benefit from throttling/debouncing
- Consider implementing Intersection Observer for scroll behavior instead of scroll events

### Files Modified During Review

- src/components/layout/Header.tsx
- src/components/layout/Navigation.tsx
- src/styles/globals.css
- src/components/layout/__tests__/Navigation.test.tsx (created)
- src/components/layout/__tests__/Header.test.tsx

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/1.3-homepage-implementation.yml

The implementation is functionally complete with all acceptance criteria met, but has minor issues that should be addressed for production readiness, particularly around performance optimization and complete accessibility compliance.

### Recommended Status

[✓ Ready for Done] - All critical issues have been addressed during review. Remaining items are minor optimizations that can be handled in future iterations.
