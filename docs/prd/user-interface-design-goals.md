# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The Princess Puff website embodies "Luxe Noir" sophistication - a digital experience where premium pastries are presented as luxury goods rather than mere confections. Every interaction should feel deliberate and refined, with generous whitespace creating breathing room that mirrors the exclusivity of the brand. The interface disappears to let products shine as heroes, using high-contrast black backgrounds with golden accents to create drama and desire. Users should feel they're browsing a high-end boutique, not a bakery website.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Immersive Product Discovery:** Full-screen product galleries with smooth transitions between items, allowing users to explore details through intuitive gestures and hover states that reveal layers of information progressively
- **Dual-Path Navigation:** Clear visual separation between B2C luxury consumer journey (emotional, visual) and B2B professional pathway (efficient, information-rich) from the homepage
- **Storytelling Through Scroll:** Narrative-driven page layouts where scrolling unveils the brand story, preparation process, and product details in cinematic sequences
- **Minimalist Form Interactions:** Contact forms that feel like concierge service requests, with subtle animations and clear feedback that maintains the premium experience
- **Content-First Mobile Experience:** Touch-optimized interfaces that prioritize product imagery and essential actions, with navigation that stays out of the way until needed

## Core Screens and Views

- **Homepage:** Hero showcase with signature donut, brand story teaser, B2C/B2B pathway selection, featured products carousel
- **Product Gallery:** Grid view with filter sidebar, hover effects revealing quick details, click-through to immersive product pages
- **Individual Product Page:** Full-screen product imagery, ingredient story, allergen info, suggested pairings, inquiry CTA
- **About/Story Page:** Visual journey through brand history, preparation process showcase, founder story with subtle scroll-triggered animations
- **B2B Portal:** Professional layout with gifting options grid, bulk order benefits, streamlined partnership inquiry form
- **Locations Hub:** Interactive map with store cards, real-time hours, parking info, contact details per location
- **News/Updates Feed:** Editorial-style layout for announcements, seasonal launches, press mentions with rich media
- **Contact Gateway:** Dual forms for retail/corporate inquiries, FAQ accordion, social media links, [Phase 2: newsletter signup]

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance ensuring the luxury experience extends to all users, including keyboard navigation with visible focus indicators, proper color contrast ratios even with the black/gold palette, screen reader optimized content structure, and alternative text for all product imagery.

## Branding

Strict adherence to the "Luxe Noir" aesthetic with black (#000000) primary backgrounds and gold (#D4A574) accent colors. Typography system: Playfair Display (or similar elegant serif) for headers with system serif fallbacks, Inter or Helvetica Neue for body text with system sans-serif fallbacks. All product photography must be on pure black backgrounds with dramatic lighting. UI elements should incorporate subtle gold gradients and thin borders. Animations should be smooth and deliberate (300-400ms transitions), never playful or bouncy. Loading states should use elegant skeleton screens maintaining brand colors.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Fully responsive design optimized for all devices from 320px mobile phones to 4K displays. Primary focus on mobile experience (expecting 60%+ mobile traffic) with touch-optimized interactions. Desktop experience should leverage larger screens for immersive product galleries. Tablet experience bridges both with adaptive layouts. Progressive enhancement approach ensuring core functionality works everywhere while adding rich interactions for capable devices.

## Rationale & Design Trade-offs

**Key decisions made:**
- Chose "Luxe Noir" over lighter themes to differentiate from typical bakery sites
- Prioritized product imagery over text content to let quality speak for itself  
- Separated B2C/B2B paths rather than unified experience to optimize conversions
- Selected WCAG AA over AAA to balance accessibility with design constraints
- Opted for narrative scroll over traditional navigation to increase engagement

**Assumptions requiring validation:**
- Black backgrounds won't cause accessibility issues if contrast is managed well
- Serbian audience will appreciate luxury positioning vs. traditional approach
- Mobile-first approach aligns with target demographic behavior
- Dramatic photography style is feasible for all products
