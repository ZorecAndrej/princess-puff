# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt

*For initiating UX/design work:*

"Please review the Princess Puff Luxury Pastry Website PRD (docs/prd.md) and the Technical Architecture document (docs/architecture.md). Create comprehensive design mockups for the Luxe Noir brand experience that align with the component structure and technical constraints defined in the architecture. Focus on the homepage hero, product gallery, and individual product pages as priorities. The design must embody black (#000000) and gold (#D4A574) luxury aesthetics while maintaining WCAG AA accessibility. Pay special attention to mobile-first responsive design and the dual B2C/B2B pathways. Ensure all designs work within the established technical framework, performance budgets, and component architecture. Deliverables should include a basic design system, key page mockups, and interaction patterns that can guide development."

## Architect Prompt

*For initiating technical architecture:*

"Please review the Princess Puff Luxury Pastry Website PRD (docs/prd.md) and create a comprehensive technical architecture. The PRD specifies Next.js 14 with App Router, Strapi CMS on Railway, and Cloudflare R2 for media storage. Focus on creating a scalable architecture that delivers the MVP in 12-14 days while preparing for future e-commerce integration. Key considerations include ISR strategy for CMS content, optimized image pipeline for luxury product photography, and a simple but effective deployment strategy using Vercel. Please produce an architecture document that a development team can immediately execute against."
