## Background Context

Princess Puff Belgrade represents a pioneering luxury pastry concept, being the first and only artisanal princess donut brand in the region. The brand differentiates itself through a unique preparation procedure, premium ingredients, and luxury packaging that positions their products as perfect gift choices. Currently lacking an online presence, the brand requires a sophisticated website that can effectively communicate their premium positioning to both individual luxury consumers (aged 25-55, higher income bracket) and B2B clients including corporate partners, event planners, and hospitality businesses.

The website must solve the immediate need for brand establishment and customer engagement while being architected to support future e-commerce capabilities. With an emphasis on the "Luxe Noir" aesthetic featuring black backgrounds with gold accents, the digital experience must mirror the premium quality of the physical products, creating an immersive brand experience that drives both direct inquiries and partnership opportunities.
