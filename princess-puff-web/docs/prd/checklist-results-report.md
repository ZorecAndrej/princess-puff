## Top Issues by Priority

**BLOCKERS:** None identified

**HIGH:**
- Serbian language support not included in MVP (critical for local market)
- Email template design not specified for luxury brand communications

**MEDIUM:**
- Docker setup simplified but may need documentation for team
- Analytics implementation moved to Epic 4 (could be earlier)

**LOW:**
- Instagram integration deferred to Phase 2
- Some security headers postponed

## MVP Scope Assessment

**Optimal Features Included:**
- Stunning homepage with dual pathways
- Complete product showcase with CMS
- Contact forms and business section
- Location pages with maps
- News system for updates

**Wisely Deferred:**
- Complex filtering (not needed for <20 products)
- Product image galleries
- Related products algorithms
- Advanced performance optimizations

**Timeline:** Realistic 12-14 day estimate with clear daily deliverables

## Technical Readiness

**Strengths:**
- Clear technology stack (Next.js 14, Strapi, Railway)
- Smart infrastructure choices (Cloudflare R2, Resend)
- Performance budgets defined
- Deployment strategy clear

**Considerations:**
- Railway cold starts acknowledged with workaround
- Scaling path identified (Railway Pro when needed)
- E-commerce architecture prepared but not over-built

## Recommendations

1. **Add Story 3.5:** Basic Serbian UI labels (1 day effort)
2. **Enhance Story 3.1:** Include React Email template for branded communications
3. **Document:** Create simple Docker setup guide for Windows developers
4. **Consider:** Moving basic analytics to Epic 1 (minimal effort, immediate value)

## Final Decision

**READY FOR ARCHITECT** âœ…

The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design. The minimal gaps identified can be addressed during development without blocking progress. The optimization from 6 weeks to 2 weeks while maintaining quality demonstrates excellent product management discipline.
